      <h2>Pollution is one of the biggest problems affecting our planet. From the air we breathe to the water we drink, pollution is everywhere, but what is pollution? </h2>
      <p1>Pollution is when harmful chemicals or materials are released into the environment, which can make our air dirty or unsafe to breathe. This can happen because pollution can affect the water we drink, the air we breathe and the environment we live in. Pollution is caused by human activity, like cars releasing exhaust fumes, factories dumping chemicals, or people littering. The damage caused by this doesn’t just hurt nature, but it also puts people and animals at risk. Over time, pollution can lead to health problems, climate change, and can slowly destroy Earth's ecosystems.</p1>
      <p1>Pollution harms not only the air we breathe and the water we drink but also the land and ecosystems that sustain life. That’s why it’s important to practice <strong>Kaitiakitanga</strong>, a Māori concept meaning guardianship or stewardship of the environment. Kaitiakitanga encourages us to protect and care for the natural world responsibly, ensuring it remains healthy and sustainable for future generations. By understanding pollution and embracing Kaitiakitanga, we can all contribute to preserving the planet.</p1>
      <p1>This website is made to help you show kaitiakitanga by understanding what pollution is, the different types of pollution that exist, shocking facts that show its impact, and most importantly, how you can help stop or reduce pollution from taking over the environment.
