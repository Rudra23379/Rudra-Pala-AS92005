  <h2>What is pollution?</h2>
      <p>Pollution is when harmful chemicals or materials are released in the environment, which can make our air dirty or unsafe to breathe. This can happen becuase pollution can affect the water we drink, air we breathe and the environment we live on. Pollution is caused by human activity, like cars releasing exhaust fumes, factories dumping chemicals, or people littering. The damage caused by this doesnâ€™t just hurt nature, but it also puts people and animals at risk. Over time, pollution can lead to health problems , climate change and can slowly destroy earths ecosystems.</p>
