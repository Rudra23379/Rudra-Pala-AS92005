     <h2>10 facts about pollution</h2>
<p>1.Air pollution causes about <strong>4,000 early deaths each year in London</strong> and around <strong>43,000 across the UK</strong>, while globally it kills <strong>more than 4.2 million</strong> people every year.</p>

<p>2.The World Health Organization has classified <strong>diesel exhaust and fine particulate matter</strong> as <strong>known human carcinogens</strong>, just like tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>3.<strong>Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)</strong> can travel deep into the lungs and bloodstream, impacting nearly every organ in the body.</p>

<p>4.<strong>Children and older adults</strong> are most at risk—kids growing up in polluted areas may have permanently reduced lung capacity.</p>

<p>5.People in <strong>ethnic minority and low-income communities</strong> in the UK are <strong>three times more likely</strong> to breathe harmfully high levels of air pollution.</p>

<p>6.The UK’s pollution limits for <strong>NO₂ and PM2.5</strong> are <strong>2–4 times weaker</strong> than what the World Health Organization recommends.</p>

<p>7.A single year of air pollution exposure costs the <strong>UK economy billions</strong> through lost productivity and health care expenses.</p>

<p>8.<strong>Indoor air pollution</strong>—especially from burning solid fuels—puts millions at risk, particularly women and children in developing countries.</p>

<p>9.Air pollution harms more than humans—it damages <strong>buildings, forests, crops</strong>, and contributes to acid rain.</p>

<p>10.Even when invisible, <strong>nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)</strong> is harmful and sometimes appears as an <strong>orange haze over cities</strong>.</p>
