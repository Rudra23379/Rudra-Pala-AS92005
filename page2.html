<div class="Pollution-types">
    <h2>Pollution comes in many forms, and each one can affect the world differently. These are some of the main types that can have an impact on our daily life's.</h2>
<h3>Air Pollution</h3>
<p>Air pollution is when harmful stuff like smoke, gases, or tiny particles get into the air we breathe. It’s also one of the reasons why some people develop breathing problems, and it’s also linked to climate change. Things like car fumes, factory smoke, and burning fuel are also major causes for air pollution and climate change.</p>

<h3>Water Pollution</h3>
<p>This happens when dirty or dangerous materials like plastic get into our rivers, lakes, or the sea. It can come from sewage, oil spills, or even chemicals used on farms. Once the water is contaminated, it’s unsafe for people and animals alike to drink from.</p>

<h3>Land Pollution</h3>
<p>When we dump trash, chemicals, or other waste onto the ground, that’s called land pollution. Besides looking bad, it can also harm plants, animals, and even our own food supply by seeping into soil and water.</p>

<h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
<p>We don’t always think of noise as pollution, but loud sounds from traffic, building sites, or machines can cause stress and hearing issues. It’s more than just annoying and over time, it can  really affect people’s mental health.</p>

<h3>Light Pollution</h3>
<p>Light pollution is caused by too many artificial lights that brighten up the night sky like streetlights or city buildings. This can mess with our sleep patterns and also confuse animals that rely on natural darkness like owls that sleep during the day. It also makes it hard to see the stars , making it harder to appreciate the beauty of the stars in the night sky</p>
